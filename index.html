        <h2>A Short History of Abstract Art</h2>
            <h3>Eastern European beginnings</h3>
                <p>Abstract art was born at the beginning of the 20th century. At this time the 
                 artistic landscape was predominantly made up of fauvism, cubism and figurative 
                 expressionism. This type of art is marked by its freedom of color, shapes and 
                 of course: it’s subject. So much so that little by little, the pictorial aspect 
                 was completely abandoned purely for form. Boldness and experimentation with color 
                 characterizes this period as the artists began to free themselves from the constraints 
                 of academia. </p>
                    
                 <p>The beginnings of abstract art are hard to pinpoint. In fact,  
                  we can see different artists with varying styles appearing simultaneously, 
                  each one bringing their own personal touch to the definition of what constitutes 
                  “abstract”. But if a date for the beginning of abstract art had to be given, 1910 
                  can be agreed upon (almost) unanimously. </p>

        <h2 class="types">10 Types of Abstract Art <span>you should know</span></h2>
            <ol>
                <h2><li>Paint Splatter, Drip, and Splash</li></h2>
                    <p>Inspired by the work of the American Abstract Expressionist Jackson Pollock, 
                    paint splatter images and drip textures bring an eclectic and energized 
                    feel to design projects. Particularly beautiful as backgrounds for 
                    packaging and large-scale print designs — such as posters and banners
                     — these types of images bring color, texture, and movement to layouts, 
                    while creating a surprisingly uniform and versatile backdrop for 
                    typography and logos.</p>
                    <img src="img/splatter.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image by Juhku</em></figcaption>
                <h2><li>Block Color</li></h2>
                    <p>Art reached new levels of abstraction through the work of American 
                     painter Mark Rothko, who was renowned for his large-scale “Color Field” 
                     paintings. His monumental canvases explored the psychological and 
                     dramatic potential of block color. </p>
                     <img src="img/block.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image by Sommai</em></figcaption>
                <h2><li>Marbling</li></h2>
                        <p>Suminagashi, the ancient art of Japanese marbling, is arguably one 
                        of the earliest forms of abstract art, with the first known example 
                        dating to the 10th century. </p>
                        <img src="img/marbling.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image by Caracolla</em></figcaption>
                <h2><li>Cubism</li></h2>
                    <p>At the start of the 20th Century, artists Pablo Picasso and Georges 
                        Braque endeavored to represent all possible viewpoints of a subject 
                        or object, all at once. The result of the experiment was Cubism, 
                        an abstract art style in which loosely-identifiable subjects appear 
                        fragmented and geometrical. </p>
                        <img src="img/cubism.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image by Unconventional</em></figcaption>
                <h2><li>Line Art</li></h2>
                    <p>Catalan artist Joan Miró combined abstract line drawings and paintings 
                        with surrealist subject matter. Much of his work used, or was influenced by, 
                        the printing process of lithography, which may have contributed to the graphic feel of his art. 
                        Abstract line art, in which simple, continuous lines were used to create forms 
                        and shapes, are a hallmark of Miró’s work and of many other abstract artists working 
                        during the 1950s and 1960s. </p>

                <h2><li>Memphis Style</li></h2>
                    <p>The eclectic Memphis Style is the result of a movement initiated 
                        by a group of Italian designers, architects, and artists in the 
                        early 1980s. Memphis style emphasizes geometry, bold color, and 
                        pattern, and touches on a range of art styles from Art Deco to Kitsch.</p>
                        <img src="img/memphis.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image by Ozz Design</em></figcaption>
                <h2><li>Abstract Organic</li></h2>
                    <p>Fluid, curving forms and muted mid-century colors are the hallmarks 
                        of the abstract organic art style. Artists such as Charles and Ray 
                        Eames revisited and reinterpreted indigenous art styles during the 1950s,
                        resulting in organic shapes and an emphasis on natural materials, textures, 
                        and colors.</p>
                        <img src="img/abstract-organic.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image by SF Stock</em></figcaption>
                <h2><li>Halftone</li></h2>
                    <p>Halftone describes the dotted effect created through printing, by breaking 
                        images up into a series of dots. The effect was replicated by pop artists 
                        such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein. During the 1960s and 1970s these 
                        artists often strove to make their artworks look like newspaper billboard ads.</p>
                        <img src="img/halftone.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image by jumpingsack</em></figcaption>
                <h2><li>Surrealism</li></h2>
                    <p>Although not strictly abstract, surrealist art aims to achieve a distorted 
                        version of reality by manipulating realist imagery. Artists such as Salvador Dalí, 
                        René Magritte, and Frida Kahlo were influenced by psychoanalysis, a growing field 
                        of study and practice in the early 20th century. Their paintings and sculptures 
                        sought to expand the creative potential of the mind, by juxtaposing images together 
                        that appeared irrational and unconventional. </p>
                        <img src="img/surrealism.jpg" alt=""><figcaption><em>Image by Tithi Luadthong</em></figcaption>
                <h2><li>Abstract Relief and Sculpture</li></h2>
                    <p>Painting is often viewed as the dominant media of abstract art. However, many 
                        artists looked to sculpture and relief to translate abstract concepts into 3D form.
                        Look to British sculptor Barbara Hepworth for ultimate abstract inspiration. 
                        Her monumental sculptures cast in metal, stone, and wood represent the pinnacle 
                        of Modernist achievement between the 1930s and 1960s.</p>
